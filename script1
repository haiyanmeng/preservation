Greetings All,
Here's a short rundown on how the tau analysis works (starting from BEANs).  
Potential caveat: you might need dbs access for this... and you should run on earth and the NDCMS condor pool.
# Ntupling
1. Create a CMS release, e.g.,
    cmsrel CMSSW_5_3_11_patch3
    cd CMSSW_5_3_11_patch3/src
    cmsenv
2. install the BEAN packages as per instructions on [github] (https://github.com/cms-ttH/BEAN/blob/master/README.md).
3. install grid-control:
        cd ~; svn co https://ekptrac.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de/public/grid-control/trunk/grid-control; cd -
4. install the TauAnalysis package:
        cd $CMSSW_BASE/src
        mkdir -p ttH
        git clone https://github.com/matz-e/TTHTauTau-Analysis.git ttH/TauAnalysis
        scram b -j32
5. fix paths (look for 'workdir' and 'se path' in ttH/TauAnalysis/test/grid_control.cfg and run the configuration:
        cd ttH/TauAnalysis/test
        vim grid_control.cfg
        voms-proxy-init -voms cms -valid 192:00 # this might not be needed?
        ~/grid-control/go.py -c grid_control.cfg
  - wait until grid-control finishes
6. Analysis
Perform the installation steps on [github](https://github.com/cms-ttH/ttH-TauRoast), then fix the paths and run the analysis:
    cd $LOCALRT/src/ttH/TauRoast/
    vim data/generic_ttl.yaml
    # look and fix items under paths to where ntuples are stored, and the 'root' under which output will be stored
    roaster -atfpvy data/generic_ttl.yaml
This will give you a yield table (how many events passed which cuts for each sample), and plots as specified in the configuration.
